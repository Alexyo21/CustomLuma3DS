## next update 
next build probably will better fix volume software control.

the release build are not synced with the latest commit so if you want to see the latest changes you know how to do it

## What is this fork
for debug build please remember to change also the sysmodule rsf to true forcedebug and false disable debug.

Many of you probably know the NTR CFW that enabled streaming the 3DS' screen to the computer over the debugger.  
This fork implements this functionality into rosalina.  
It's still higly WIP and not intended for public use since framerates are quite slow.  
But it's more stable than the NTR firmware. You can switch games and the games I tested worked flawlessly.  
Some of the code is inspired by NTR but most of it is a complete reimplementation, because I wanted to figure out where the annoying bugs with the NTR firmware are. (e.g. 3DS hanging when switching processes)

### What's in here also  different from official luma3DS?

    Restored UNITINFO and enable rosalina on safe_firm and disable arm11exceptions  and alos cut down wifi options on the luma config menu
    Added shortcuts:
        Press start + select to toggle bottom screen (nice when you watch videos) inspired by This, limit on o2ds
        , cause hardware register for up and down lcd are the same looking for new test though... 
        Press A + B + X + Y + Start to instantly reboot the console. Useful in case of freeze, but don't complain if your sdcard get corrupted because of this. also this needs to be activated 
        Press Start on Rosalina menu to toggle wifi -> From here
        Press Select on Rosalina menu to toggle LEDs -> From this (and press Y to force blue led as a workaround when the battery is low)

### What it is
**Luma3DS** is a program to patch the system software of (New) Nintendo (2)3DS handheld consoles "on the fly", adding features such as per-game language settings, debugging capabilities for developers, and removing restrictions enforced by Nintendo such as the region lock.

It also allows you to run unauthorized ("homebrew") content by removing signature checks.
To use it, you will need a console capable of running homebrew software on the Arm9 processor.

Since v8.0, Luma3DS has its own in-game menu, triggerable by <kbd>L+Up</kbd> (see the [release notes](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/tag/v8.0)).
